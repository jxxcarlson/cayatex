[section1 Standard Elements]



[section2 Text]

[def | bold; b |
Render text as bold, e.g, [c raw#[bold Bold!]#] renders as [ds [bold Bold!]] Short form: [c raw#[b Bold!]#] .
]

[def | italic; i |
Render text as italic, e.g, [c raw#[italic Italic!]#] renders as [ds [italic Italic!]] Short form: [c raw#[i Italic!]#] .
]

[def | fontRGB | Render text in color with given RGB values, e.g., [c raw#[fontRGB |214, 11, 184| This is a test!]#] renders as
[fontRGB |214, 11, 184| This is a test!]

]


[def | highlight |
Highlight the text, e.g, [c raw#[highlight This is important!]#] renders as [ds [highlight This is important!]].
]

[def | link |
Make a hyperlink.  For example, the text, e.g, [c raw#[link http://nytimes.com]#] renders as [ds[link http://nytimes.com]].  One can also specify the link text, e.g., [c raw#[link | New York Times | http://nytimes.com]#] renders as [ds[link | New York Times | http://nytimes.com]].
]

[def | highlightRGB |
Highlight the text with a given color, e.g, [c raw# [highlightRGB | 255, 200, 200 | This is important!]#] renders as [ds [highlightRGB | 255, 200, 200 | This is important!]].
]

[section2 Code]

[def | code; c|
Render text in-line as code, e.g, [c raw#[code a <- b]#] renders as
[ds [code a <- b]] Short form: [c raw#[c a <- b]#] .
]

[def |  codeblock; cb |
Render text as displayed code, e.g, [c raw#[codeblock a <- b]#] renders as

[ds [codeblock a <- b]]

Short form: [c raw#[c a <- b]#] .
]


[section2 Mathematics]

[def | math; m |
Render math in-line, e.g, [c raw#[math a^2 + b^2 = c^2]#] renders as
[ds [math a^2 + b^2 = c^2]] Short form: [c raw#[m a^2 + b^2 = c^2]#] .
]

[def |  mathblock; mb |
Render math as centered block, e.g, [c raw#[mathblock \\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}]#] renders as

[mathblock \\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}]

Short form: [c raw#[mb \\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}]#] .
]


[section2 Structure]

[def | title | Construct a document title, e.g. as [c raw#[title Tales of Yore]#] ].

[def | tableofcontents |
Render a numbered table of contents as displayed above.]

[def | section; section1; section2; ... |
Render a numbered section heading as you see here.  For example,
[c raw#[section2 Structure]#] produces the heading for this section.  It is a level two heading and therefore is labeled with two numbers. [c section] is a synonym for [c section1], which produces a level 1 section heading.

[section2 Format]

[def | center | Center the body of the element [c raw#[center BODY]#]].

[def | indent | Indent the body of the element [c raw#[indent BODY]#]].

[def | poetry | Format the body of the element as poetry, that is, obey line endings. [c raw#[poetry BODY]#]].

[def | verbatim | No formatting at all: obey line endings and white space. [c raw#[poetry BODY]#]].

[def | list | Construct a list of items using the form [c raw#[list [tem ...] [item ...] ...]#]  The default is a bulleted list.  To change the "item symbol", add the argument [c raw#|s : SYMBOL-NAME|#], e.g., write [c raw#[list | s: ‡ | ...]#] to produce the example below.  For a numbered list, use the special form [c raw#[list | s: numbered | ...]#]
]


[b Example]

To produce the list

[list  | s: ‡ |

  [item Conservation of momentum]

  [item  Conservation of energy]

]

write

[cb raw##
[list  | s: ‡ |

  [item Conservation of momentum]

  [item  Conservation of energy]

]
##]

[section2 Images]

Insert an image using the format [c raw#[image URL]#], where
 [c URL] is a link to the image.  The image below was inserted using the source text
[c raw#[image https://pcd ... jpg] #]

[image https://pcdn.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0427_LIF_kidspost-herons-1226x0-c-default.jpg]


To change the width of an image to 150 pixels, say [c raw#[image | width: 150 | URL]#]


[image | width: 150| https://pcdn.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0427_LIF_kidspost-herons-1226x0-c-default.jpg]

To add a caption, say [c raw#[image | width: 150, caption Egrets | URL]#]


[image | width: 150, caption: Egrets | https://pcdn.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0427_LIF_kidspost-herons-1226x0-c-default.jpg]

The arguments to the image element are a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, [c key:value].  You have seen how the width key is used with a numeric value.  You can also say [c width: fill] to make the image as wide as possible.  This is the default.  Another key is [c placement], which can take values [c left], [c right], and [c center].

Below is a variant of the Egret image with placement on the left.  We will have floating placement left and right in the near future.

[image | width: 150, caption: Egrets , placement: left| https://pcdn.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0427_LIF_kidspost-herons-1226x0-c-default.jpg] 


[b Note.] To copy the link of an image on the web, do control-click or right-click on the image and select "Copy image link" from the popup menu.

[section2 Data]

[def | sum |
  Compute sum of a list of numbers, e.g., [c raw#[sum 1, 2, 3]#] renders as [ds [sum 1, 2, 3]].]

[def | average |
  Compute average of a list of numbers, e.g., [c raw#[average 1, 2, 3]#] renders as [ds [average 1, 2, 3]].]

[def | stdev |
  Compute standard deviation of a list of numbers, e.g., [c raw#[stdev 1, 2, 3]#] renders as [ds [stdev 1, 2, 3]].]

[section2 Graphs and Charts]

[def | bargraph |

Construct a bar graph from data in CSV format, e.g., the text

[cb raw#[bargraph
1
1.5
3
0.2
]#
]

renders as

[bargraph
1
1.5
3
0.2
