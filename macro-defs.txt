[section1 Standard Elements]



[section2 Text]

[def | bold; b |
Render text as bold, e.g, [c raw#[bold Bold!]#] renders as [ds [bold Bold!]] Short form: [c raw#[b Bold!]#] .
]

[section2 Code]

[def | code; c|
Render text in-line as code, e.g, [c raw#[code a <- b]#] renders as
[ds [code a <- b]] Short form: [c raw#[c a <- b]#] .
]

[def |  codeblock; cb |
Render text as displayed code, e.g, [c raw#[codeblock a <- b]#] renders as

[ds [codeblock a <- b]]

Short form: [c raw#[c a <- b]#] .
]


[section2 Mathematics]

[def | math; m |
Render math in-line, e.g, [c raw#[math a^2 + b^2 = c^2]#] renders as
[ds [math a^2 + b^2 = c^2]] Short form: [c raw#[m a^2 + b^2 = c^2]#] .
]

[def |  mathblock; mb |
Render math as centered block, e.g, [c raw#[mathblock \int_0^1 x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1}]#] renders as

[mathblock \int_0^1 x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1}]

Short form: [c raw#[mb \int_0^1 x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1}]#] .
]


[section2 Structure]

[def | tableofcontents |
Render a numbered table of contents as displayed above.]

[def | section; section1; section2; ... |
Render a numbered section heading as you see here.  For example,
[c raw#[section2 Structure]#] produces the heading for this section.  It is a level two heading and therefore is labeled with two numbers. [c section] is a synonym for [c section1], which produces a level 1 section heading.

[section2 Data]

[def | average |
  Compute average of a list of numbers, e.g., [c raw#[average 1, 2, 3]#] renders as [ds [average 1, 2, 3]].]


[section2 Graphs and Charts]

[def | bargraph |

Construct a bar graph from data in CSV format, e.g., the text

[cb raw#[bargraph
1

]]

renders as
